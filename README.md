This Path Tracer was based heavily on [Sebastian Lague's Path Tracer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz0KTGYJtUk&t=1870s&ab_channel=SebastianLague)
Unfortunately I learned after the fact that while Sebastian's solution is very intuitive to understnad, it's not as scalable or robust as I'd like. Specifically Lague's video doesn't go into depth on BRDF, BSDF, PDF, etc. Exploring these acronyms is sort of next on the path tracing docket

I'm told that [Physically Based Rendering:From Theory To Implementation](https://pbr-book.org/) would be a good place to move onto to get deeper into the subject.
